This is a simple e-commerce application built using React that allows users to select products and add them to a cart. The app is composed of three main components: App.js, Product.jsx, and Cart.jsx.

    App.js
    This is the main component that renders the entire application. It contains the state for selected products, the functions to add products to the cart, show the product container, show the cart container, and buy products. It also calculates the total price of selected products and renders the product and cart components based on user interactions.

    Product.jsx
    This component renders individual products with their name, price, and an add-to-cart button. When the user clicks the button, the addProduct function from the App component is called, which adds the selected product to the selectedProducts array in the App component's state.

    Cart.jsx
    This component renders the list of selected products in the cart container along with their name and price. It also calculates the total price of all selected products and displays it. When the user clicks the buy button, the buyProducts function from the App component is called, which empties the selectedProducts array and adds the selected products to the purchased array.

Overall, this React app provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to select and purchase products.
